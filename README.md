# Multi-objective matheuristic for minimization of total tardiness and energy costs in a steel industry heat treatment line

## About

This repository contains the dataset used in the evaluation of the multi-objective matheuristic proposed in the manuscript entitled "Multi-objective matheuristic for minimization of total tardiness and energy costs in a steel industry heat treatment line" (under submission).

The optimization parameters of the test instances and its usage instructions can be found [here](instances/real-case/inputs). The raw ouput data of the computational experiments is also shared [here](instances/real-case/outputs) with the R script (R version 3.6.3) used to generate the manuscript result tables, figures, and statistical analysis.
